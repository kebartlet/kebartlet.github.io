Because of their long working hours, up until she entered pre-school, she was largely raised by her paternal grandparents, immigrants from South Korea with limited <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_self">English</a> proficiency.

This paired excellently with a natural curiosity, a spirit best characterized as "I wonder if I could get X to do Y."<br>At age 12, she moved to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino%2C_California" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino%2C_California" target="_self">Cupertino, California</a>, home to the global headquarters for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." target="_self">Apple</a>, which she lived less than 4 miles from.

Amidst struggling with her sexual orientation and gender identity in an America that was still slowly beginning to come to terms with its <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_people" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_people" target="_self">LGBTQ</a> members, and the challenges of being different in a household environment that demanded conformity, she experienced periods of homelessness that eventually resulted in her being officially placed in the foster care system, where she bounced from placement to placement until aging out of foster care, during which time she also managed to graduate high school early at the age of 16.<br>At the young age of 17, after graduating high school as a 16 year old, K.E. started her career working full time in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley" target="_self">Silicon Valley</a> high tech industry as an IT Engineer &amp; field CIO for a Managed Service Provider. In that role, she handled the IT needs of various high tech client companies, often tasked with IT infrastructure deployments and managing security matters for clients ranging from medical institutions to biotechnology startups to manufacturing companies. During this same period, she began working her way through her undergraduate degree at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_New_Hampshire_University" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_New_Hampshire_University" target="_self">Southern New Hampshire University</a>, selected primarily for its affordability and compatibility with the 60 to 80 hour weeks she found herself working.As she progressed through the field, often working two or more jobs at the same time, both to accelerate her career and to build financial security in one of the highest cost of living metropolitan areas in the world, she found herself working in progressively more senior engineering roles at Apple at age 20, Facebook at age 22, and more as she worked her way up the tech industry's ladder. During this same period of time, she also found herself working in various public sector roles across various levels of government and areas of responsibility.<br>She also began to develop an budding entrepreneurial nature, founding her own consultancy, creating a banner under which she and other high tech professionals could <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job" target="_self">moonlight</a> more effectively. Under this umbrella, she led a diverse team of professionals in offering an excellent business value proposition for their clients, handling matters ranging from modernizing their technology environments to handling major security incidents to advising on the intersection of technology and finance among other high value services.<br>At the age of 23, she also started teaching in the higher education setting as an adjunct professor and later guest lecturer, forging a path through various universities with industry credentials in quickly evolving technical fields that negated any concerns about her youth. This also led to her working with the technology industry certifying body <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://comptia.org" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://comptia.org" target="_self">CompTIA</a> as one of its Subject Matter Experts, helping set the standards and write the certifying exams for the next generation of technology industry practitioners, an experience she found particularly enjoyable compared to even the best highlights of her diverse career, getting to eat great food while arguing with other incredibly intelligent technology professionals.<br><img alt="My Dumpling Your Dumpling" src="mdyd-2.0-option-5.jpg" target="_self"><br>

If you've read this far, congratulations. You get to know that K.E. Bartlet is a nom de plume. A pen name.All the other details remain accurate, but in addition to being a veteran cybersecurity professional who values her privacy, she started her publishing journey before the severing of her remaining affiliations with the United States Government was complete.So to avoid any issues with regulations governing political activity (which she interpreted to include publishing a novel with significant political themes), she published under her nom de plume, and once she started publishing under that name, it became easier to keep publishing under that name. Now that she no longer has any relationship with the Big Green Weenie of Uncle Sam, she does engage with some of her readers and fans as her true self.For anyone who's interested, this is where the name comes from:<br>K = Katherine, after <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson" target="_self">Katherine Goble Johnson</a>, an American mathematician who helped the free world win the space race. She was played by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraji_P._Henson" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraji_P._Henson" target="_self">Taraji P.

"If only we could have a President like that again in the United States, but this time for real instead of on our screens." is a sentiment often expressed by K.E. Bartlet.And as to why K.E. instead of Katherine E. or Katherine Elizabeth, she deliberately chose to use initials to combat any internalized misogyny that might deter a reader in the political techno thriller genre from considering her books, instead opting to let the quality of the works themselves stand on their own, a common practice by female authors throughout history.]]></description><link>k.e.-bartlet.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">K.E.
