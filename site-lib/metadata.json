In that role, she handled the IT needs of various high tech client companies, often tasked with IT infrastructure deployments and managing security matters for clients ranging from medical institutions to biotechnology startups to manufacturing companies. During this same period, she began working her way through her undergraduate degree at <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_New_Hampshire_University\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_New_Hampshire_University\" target=\"_self\">Southern New Hampshire University</a>, selected primarily for its affordability and compatibility with the 60 to 80 hour weeks she found herself working.As she progressed through the field, often working two or more jobs at the same time, both to accelerate her career and to build financial security in one of the highest cost of living metropolitan areas in the world, she found herself working in progressively more senior engineering roles at Apple at age 20, Facebook at age 22, and more as she worked her way up the tech industry's ladder. During this same period of time, she also found herself working in various public sector roles across various levels of government and areas of responsibility.<br>She also began to develop an budding entrepreneurial nature, founding her own consultancy, creating a banner under which she and other high tech professionals could <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job\" target=\"_self\">moonlight</a> more effectively.

You get to know that K.E. Bartlet is a nom de plume. A pen name.All the other details remain accurate, but in addition to being a veteran cybersecurity professional who values her privacy, she started her publishing journey before the severing of her remaining affiliations with the United States Government was complete.So to avoid any issues with regulations governing political activity (which she interpreted to include publishing a novel with significant political themes), she published under her nom de plume, and once she started publishing under that name, it became easier to keep publishing under that name. Now that she no longer has any relationship with the Big Green Weenie of Uncle Sam, she does engage with some of her readers and fans as her true self.For anyone who's interested, this is where the name comes from:<br>K = Katherine, after <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson\" target=\"_self\">Katherine Goble Johnson</a>, an American mathematician who helped the free world win the space race.

Bartlet.And as to why K.E. instead of Katherine E. or Katherine Elizabeth, she deliberately chose to use initials to combat any internalized misogyny that might deter a reader in the political techno thriller genre from considering her books, instead opting to let the quality of the works themselves stand on their own, a common practice by female authors throughout history.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Early life and education","level":1,"id":"Early_life_and_education_0"},{"heading":"Career","level":1,"id":"Career_0"},{"heading":"Published and Upcoming Books","level":1,"id":"Published_and_Upcoming_Books_0"},{"heading":"Other Projects","level":1,"id":"Other_Projects_0"},{"heading":"Educational Content Creation","level":2,"id":"Educational_Content_Creation_0"},{"heading":"Creative Community","level":2,"id":"Creative_Community_0"},{"heading":"Personal Life","level":1,"id":"Personal_Life_0"},{"heading":"External Links","level":1,"id":"External_Links_0"},{"heading":"Thank you for reading this far.","level":1,"id":"Thank_you_for_reading_this_far._0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"k.e.-bartlet.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":["author-ke-bartlet-picture.html","mdyd-2.0-option-5.html","operation-danger-close-[compressed].html"],"createdTime":1755188353950,"modifiedTime":1755224394720,"sourceSize":19063,"sourcePath":"K.E.
